## Sharrieâ€™s Signature

## Description

A simple shopping app that displays a list of products/items fetched from the Timu API and includes a checkout screen.

## Commit Convention

Conventional Commits is a specification for adding human and machine-readable meaning to commit messages. The format is:

```bash

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types

- feat: A new feature
- fix: A bug fix
- docs: Documentation only changes
- style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- perf: A code change that improves performance
- test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- ci: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
- chore: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
- revert: Reverts a previous commit
...

## Objectives

- Create a pixel-perfect shopping app based on the Timbu Shop designs.

- Checkout screen displays the products added for checkout.
- Functionality to add and remove items from the checkout.
- A button to navigate to an "Order Successful" screen from the checkout screen.
